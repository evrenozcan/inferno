Inforno is an experimental low level, platform independent,
canvas based graphichs library that designed for mobile devices.

Inferno was designed and developed in a day or two so currently it is experimental 
however it is still capable providing cool apps.

I added anroid implementaion and a android game using this library, 
The game has many nested windows and animation examples within. 

The framework makes it easy to create platform independent nested windows
layers and custom compoents, It contains some APIs for canvas based 2d game programming 
(Sound managers etc). Its  built in high perf 
engine also capable of complicated graphic processing and propagating events from UI thread
as well as other sources (Accelorometer etc.). The engine also enables
developer to queue sub process which can be run synch on asynch.
There are also many built in animations (slied, shake fade affect..)
